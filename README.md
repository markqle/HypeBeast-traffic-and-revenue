# HypeBeast-traffic-and-revenue
Company Hypebeast sells fashion merchandise. They have stores in each countryâ€™s capital: UK (London); FR (Paris); IT (Milan); GER (Berlin). Their customers either buy online or in the store itself. 
At the same time, it maintains a website of individual product pages with write ups and images about the page. In some cases, the page might have gone up after the product was put up for sale. 
Manager would like to use of this data and achieve these objectives: 
1.	What is the impact of our website traffic on revenue? 
2.	Which products get us pageviews and revenue?
3.	What customer segments are there?

Note: management is not data-savvy, have to create a report to help them understand your conclusions.
